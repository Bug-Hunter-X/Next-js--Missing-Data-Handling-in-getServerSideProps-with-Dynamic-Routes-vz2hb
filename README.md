# Next.js: Missing Data Handling in getServerSideProps with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js applications related to data fetching within `getServerSideProps` when using dynamic routes.  The issue occurs when fetching data based on a route parameter, but neglecting to properly handle situations where the requested data might not exist.

This can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes, particularly in production environments.

**The Problem:**
The `bug.js` file shows an example of how missing error handling can lead to unexpected crashes. When a product with a non-existent ID is requested, the application will fail.

**The Solution:**
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution, implementing proper error handling to gracefully manage situations where data is not found.  It includes checks to ensure a product exists before attempting to render its information, preventing crashes and providing better user experience.
